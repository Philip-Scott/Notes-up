On elementary OS? Hit the button to get Notes-Up!

#### Not on elementary?
Notes-Up is made for elementary OS, but has been built and made available elsewhere by community members. These builds may have modifications or changes and are not provided or supported by me.

Notes-Up is available for [openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/notes-up), and [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=notes-up).

You can also install Notes-Up from a PPA. But be aware that your results may vary and it may require the elementary OS PPA as it uses a newer version of the granite library.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:philip.scott/notes-up
# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/stable
